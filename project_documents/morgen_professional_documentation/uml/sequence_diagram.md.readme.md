# Documentation for sequence_diagram.md

## File Purpose
This file contains sequence diagrams that illustrate the dynamic behavior of the Morgen AI Paradigm system, showing how objects interact over time to accomplish key system operations. It provides the temporal view of system behavior complementing the static class structure.

## File Structure
- **Overview**: Introduction to sequence modeling
- **Dream Cycle Execution**: Core cognitive processing sequence
- **Symbol Creation and Integration**: Symbol lifecycle management
- **Wave Propagation**: Dynamic wave behavior through cognitive space
- **Arabic Text Processing**: Language processing workflow
- **Self-Awareness Analysis**: Meta-cognitive processing sequence
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learning and adaptation workflow
- **Timing Considerations**: Performance characteristics and critical paths

## Key Components

### Sequence Categories
1. **Core Operations**: Dream cycles, symbol management, wave propagation
2. **AI Processing**: Self-awareness, adaptive learning, insight generation
3. **Language Processing**: Arabic text analysis and semantic mapping
4. **System Integration**: Component interactions and data flow

### Mermaid Sequence Diagrams
- **Participants**: System components and actors
- **Messages**: Method calls and data exchanges
- **Activation Boxes**: Object lifelines and processing periods
- **Notes**: Important processing phases and conditions
- **Loops and Alternatives**: Conditional and iterative behaviors

### Timing Analysis
- **Performance Characteristics**: Computational complexity for each operation
- **Critical Paths**: Most time-consuming operations
- **Scalability Considerations**: Performance with increasing system size

## Dependencies
- class_diagram.md (for object structure understanding)
- Source code implementation (for accurate sequence modeling)
- use_case_diagram.md (for functional context)
- Original system files (main.ring, test files)

## Technical Details
- **Notation**: UML 2.5 sequence diagram notation
- **Diagram Tool**: Mermaid.js sequenceDiagram syntax
- **Message Types**: Synchronous (->), asynchronous (-->), return (->>)
- **Control Structures**: loops, alternatives (alt), optional (opt)

## Sequence Specifications
Each sequence includes:
- **Participants**: Objects and actors involved
- **Trigger**: Initial event or condition
- **Main Flow**: Primary sequence of interactions
- **Alternative Flows**: Exception and variation handling
- **Postconditions**: Resulting system state

## Usage Notes
This document serves as:
- Implementation guide for complex operations
- Debugging reference for interaction issues
- Performance analysis baseline
- Integration testing specification
