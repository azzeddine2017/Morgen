# Documentation for use_case_diagram.md

## File Purpose
This file contains the use case diagram and detailed use case specifications for the Morgen AI Paradigm system. It defines the system's functional requirements from a user perspective, identifying actors and their interactions with the system.

## File Structure
- **Overview**: Introduction to the use case model
- **Actors**: Primary and secondary system actors
- **Use Cases**: Core system functionality descriptions
- **Detailed Use Case Descriptions**: Comprehensive specifications for each use case
- **Use Case Relationships**: Include and extend relationships
- **System Boundaries**: Definition of system scope

## Key Components

### Actor Definitions
- **Primary Actors**: Direct system users (Researcher, Developer, End User, System Administrator)
- **Secondary Actors**: External systems and supporting entities

### Use Case Categories
1. **Core Cognitive Operations**: Symbol management, dream cycles, insight generation
2. **Language Processing**: Arabic text processing and linguistic analysis
3. **System Management**: Configuration, testing, data import/export
4. **Visualization**: Knowledge structure display and interaction

### Mermaid Diagrams
Uses Mermaid.js syntax for visual representation of:
- Actor-use case relationships
- System boundaries
- Use case dependencies

## Dependencies
- analysis/requirements_analysis.md (for requirement traceability)
- Original system source code (for accurate use case identification)
- class_diagram.md (for implementation understanding)

## Usage Notes
This document serves as:
- Functional specification reference
- User story source for development
- Test case derivation basis
- System scope definition

## Technical Details
- **Diagram Format**: Mermaid.js graph syntax
- **Use Case Format**: Structured template with preconditions, main flow, postconditions
- **Relationship Types**: Include, extend, and generalization relationships

## Maintenance
- Update when new features are added
- Revise actor definitions as system evolves
- Maintain consistency with requirements analysis
- Keep use case descriptions current with implementation
