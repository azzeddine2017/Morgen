# Documentation for requirements_analysis.md

## File Purpose
This file contains a comprehensive analysis of the functional and non-functional requirements for the Morgen AI Paradigm system. It serves as the foundational requirements specification derived from the existing implementation and documentation, providing the basis for all subsequent design and documentation work.

## File Structure
- **Overview**: Introduction to requirements analysis methodology
- **Functional Requirements**: Core system capabilities and features
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Quality attributes and constraints
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Technical and business limitations
- **Requirements Traceability**: Mapping to source files and test coverage

## Key Components

### Functional Requirements Categories
1. **Core Cognitive Operations**: Symbol management, cognitive space, dream cycles, relations
2. **Advanced AI Features**: Self-awareness, adaptive learning, memory, insights
3. **Language Processing**: Arabic language support, linguistic engine
4. **Geometric and Mathematical Operations**: Utilities, wave propagation, emergent structures
5. **User Interface Requirements**: GUI and CLI interfaces

### Non-Functional Requirements Categories
1. **Performance Requirements**: Response time, scalability, memory usage
2. **Reliability Requirements**: System stability, data integrity
3. **Usability Requirements**: User experience, accessibility
4. **Maintainability Requirements**: Code quality, extensibility

### Requirements Specification Format
Each requirement includes:
- **Unique ID**: Hierarchical identifier (FR-### or NFR-###)
- **Description**: Clear statement of the requirement
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Source**: Originating file or document
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success conditions

## Dependencies
- Original README.md and project_info.md
- Source code files in morgen/ directory
- GUI implementation files
- Test suite files
- Existing system documentation

## Technical Details
- **Requirements Format**: Structured template with ID, description, priority, source, criteria
- **Traceability Matrix**: Mapping requirements to implementation and tests
- **Coverage Analysis**: Test coverage assessment for each requirement
- **Priority Classification**: Critical path and importance ranking

## Requirements Analysis Methodology
1. **Source Analysis**: Review existing code and documentation
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identify implemented capabilities
3. **Requirement Derivation**: Formulate formal requirements
4. **Classification**: Categorize by type and priority
5. **Traceability**: Map to sources and tests
6. **Validation**: Verify completeness and accuracy
